Fatqc is a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data.

Tool Installtion : Tool can be installed using a link  ( link : https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) 

It is very important to check the quality of the data before we shall do any analysis on it. As data quality will decide whether or not the data is good enough for further analysis.
FastQC tool will provide informations like
